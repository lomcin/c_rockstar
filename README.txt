The task here is to find force applied to a block of mass=1kg that minimizes the cost function. The cost function penalizes error in final distance and velocity and force^2. The goal distance is 1m and the goal velocity is 0m/s at 1s. The optimal trajectory will not reach 1m and the optimal final velocity will not reach 0m/s either since the force^2 is penalized.

Run CMA-ES too for comparison
