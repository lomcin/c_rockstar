function [cur_theta_new,E_temp_prev] = gradient_descent(Near_policies, Near_costs, cov_inv, initial)

%  Input:   Near_policies, a Matrix where each column is a experienced
%  parameter vector. Dimension=Number of variables to learn X Number of
%  experiences obtained (or depends on how many you pick for simplification).
%           
%           Near_costs, a row vector where each element corresponds to cost
%           of the Near_policies. Dimension=Number of experiences obtained
%           
%           cov, noise covariance. Dimension=number of variables^2
%
%           cov_inv= inverse of cov (it is calculated prior to shorten
%           calculation time)
%
%           initial= initial point of gradient descent
%
%           cost2policy_cov_factor= currently not used
%
%  Output: cur_theta_new, minimum vector found by gradient descent,
%           Dimension= same as policy vector
%          E_temp_prev= expected cost at cur_theta_new
%
%          Note that multiple initialization is needed in more complex cost
%          functions
